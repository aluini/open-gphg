# Open GPHG

This project contains results data for the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Gen√®ve (GPHG).

## Project Structure
- `results.json`: Contains the results data for each GPHG edition in JSON format. The structure is as follows:
   - An array of objects, each representing a GPHG edition (e.g., `"edition": "2001"`).
   - Each edition has a list of `categories` (e.g., Complicated Watch, Jewelry Watch).
   - Each category includes:
      - `name`: The category name in English.
      - `original_name`: The original name of the category.
      - `watches`: An array of watches nominated in that category.
         - Each watch entry includes:
            - `name`: The watch model.
            - `brand`: The manufacturer.
            - `brand_group`: The group the brand belongs to.
            - `brands`: An array with brand details (`name`, `role`, `group`).
            - `is_collaboration`: Boolean indicating if the watch is a collaboration.
            - `winner`: (optional) Boolean indicating if the watch won the category.

This structure allows for detailed analysis of GPHG results by year, category, brand, and watch.
